# O(2^n) - Exponential Time Complexity
- An algorithm has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) if its runtime doubles with each additional input element. This means that if the input size increases by one, the runtime will double.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

- In this example, the `fibonacci` function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The time complexity is O(2^n) because each call to `fibonacci(n)` results in two additional calls to `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`, leading to an exponential growth in the number of function calls as n increases.
