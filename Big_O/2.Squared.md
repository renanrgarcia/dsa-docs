# O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity
- An algorithm has a quadratic time complexity of O(n^2) if its runtime grows quadratically with the input size. This means that if the input size doubles, the runtime increases by a factor of four.

```java
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { // O(n)
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) { // O(n)
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- In this example, the `bubbleSort` function sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm. The time complexity is O(n^2) because there are two nested loops, each iterating through the array. The outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs up to n times, resulting in n * n = n^2 operations in the worst case.

```lua
-- Example of O(n^2) time complexity: Square coordinates printing algorithm
function printSquareCoordinates(n)
    for i = 1, n do -- rows O(n)
        for j = 1, n do -- columns O(n)
            print("Processing coordinates (" .. i .. ", " .. j .. ")")
        end
    end
end
```
- In this example, the `printSquareCoordinates` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the coordinates of a square grid of size n x n. The time complexity is O(n^2) because there are two nested loops that iterate through the rows and columns of the grid, resulting in n * n = n^2 operations in the worst case.
