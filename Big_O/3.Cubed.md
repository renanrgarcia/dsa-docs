# O(n^3) - Cubic Time Complexity
- An algorithm has a cubic time complexity of O(n^3) if its runtime grows cubically with the input size. This means that if the input size doubles, the runtime increases by a factor of eight.

```c
// Example of O(n^3) time complexity: Matrix coordinates algorithm
include <stdio.h>
void cubeMatrix(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // O(n) rows
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // O(n) columns
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) { // O(n) depth
                // Perform some operation with i, j, k
                printf("Processing coordinates (%d, %d, %d)\n", i, j, k);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- In this example, the `cubeMatrix` function takes an integer `n` as input and processes the coordinates of a cubic grid of size n x n x n. The time complexity is O(n^3) because there are three nested loops that iterate through the rows, columns, and depth of the grid, resulting in n * n * n = n^3 operations in the worst case.
